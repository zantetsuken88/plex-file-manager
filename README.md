#PontyPlex - File Manager

- A file manager over http designed for easy uploading of new context to the file storage serving your Plex Media Server instance
- **CRITICAL! App is not production-ready and absolutely should not be used on your production Plex Server.**


- In order to run for development/experimental purposes, simply run client using `npm start` and server using `node index.js`
- See `.env.example` for the limited config necessary. 


- This is a pet project which is very much a WIP. If you happen to come across this code and have any feedback/suggestions/issues, please feel free to raise an issue or contact me directly. 

Enjoy!
